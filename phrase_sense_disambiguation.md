| <small>1 | <small>In the libretto, Delilah is portrayed as a seductive "femme fatale", but the music played during her parts invokes sympathy for her. The 1949 biblical drama "Samson and Delilah", directed by Cecil B. DeMille and starring Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr in the titular roles, was widely praised by critics for its cinematography, lead performances, costumes, sets, and innovative special effects. It became the highest-grossing film of 1950, and was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning two. According to "Variety", the film portrays Samson as a stereotypical "handsome but dumb hulk of muscle". Samson has been especially honored in Russian artwork because the Russians defeated the Swedes in the Battle of Poltava on the feast day of St. Sampson, whose name is homophonous with Samson’s. The lion slain by Samson was interpreted to represent Sweden, as a result of the lion’s placement on the Swedish coat of arms. In 1735, C. B. Rastrelli’s bronze statue of Samson slaying the lion was placed in the center of the great cascade of the fountain at Peterhof Palace in Saint Petersburg. Samson is the emblem of Lungau, Salzburg and parades in his honor are held annually in ten villages of the Lungau and two villages in the north-west Styria (Austria). During the parade, a young bachelor from the community carries a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">massive figure</span> made of wood or aluminum said to represent Samson. The tradition, which was first documented in 1635, was entered into the UNESCO list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Austria in 2010. Samson is one of the giant figures at the "Ducasse" festivities, which take place at Ath, Belgium. <br/><br/> On September 22, 2015, Honda announced that they had sold over 1 million Activas in five months in the Indian market, from April to August. Honda launched their 5th generation of Honda Activa in 2018, and the sixth-generation Honda Activa 6G have been launched in India with prices starting at 63,912 (ex-showroom, Delhi). Milestones. In April, 2014, "The Economic Times" reported the Honda Activa to be the best selling two wheeler in India, outselling the Hero Splendor. During the month of September 2013, 141,996 Honda Activa scooters were sold, nearly equal to Honda’s entire annual sales in North America. The 110cc Activa is the company’s biggest seller, by far. It is responsible for over 2,00,000 sales units each month. In November 2018, HMSI crossed the 2.5 crore sales mark in the scooter segment. It has become the first company to reach this milestone and the biggest contributor to this <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">massive figure</span> is the Honda Activa. It took Honda 13 years to achieve the one crore sales figure, but it managed to add another crore in the span of just three years. It then went on to achieve the next 50 lakh in just one year. | <small>huge model  | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">massive figure</span> |
| <small>2 | <small>Bubble memory is a type of non-volatile computer memory that uses a thin film of a magnetic material to hold small magnetized areas, known as "bubbles" or "domains", each storing one bit of data. The material is arranged to form a series of parallel tracks that the bubbles can move along under the action of an external magnetic field. The bubbles are read by moving them to the edge of the material where they can be read by a conventional magnetic pickup, and then rewritten on the far edge to keep the memory cycling through the material. In operation, bubble memories are similar to delay line memory systems. Bubble memory started out as a promising technology in the 1970s, offering memory density of an order similar to hard drives but performance more comparable to core memory while lacking any moving parts. This led many to consider it a contender for a "universal memory" that could be used for all <span style="background-color: #00FF00">storage needs</span>. The introduction of dramatically faster semiconductor memory chips pushed bubble into the slow end of the scale, and equally dramatic improvements in hard drive capacity made it uncompetitive in price terms. Bubble memory was used for some time in the 1970s and 80s where its non-moving nature was desirable for maintenance or shock-proofing reasons. The introduction of Flash RAM and similar technologies rendered even this niche uncompetitive, and bubble disappeared entirely by the late 1980s. History. Precursors. <br/><br/> The Inkerman stone, of which the building is made, was mined near Sevastopol and transported by barges. No convenient mooring facilities existed at that time, so the barges had to anchor in the harbor and the load was moved to the shore by boats and then transported to the construction site across the steppe. During the first year of construction, the builders concentrated on the basic structure at the expense of various facilities and decorations. At the end of 1816, the lighthouse looked like a conic 36-metre-high stone tower with a wooden 3.3-metre-high decagonal lantern. The lighthouse became operational in 1817 after its lighting system had been repaired. Three houses were built next to the tower to accommodate the lighthouse personnel and for <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">storage needs</span>. However, cold and humid winters of the Tarkhanut Peninsula, however, made these houses nearly unsuitable for living. In 1862, the lighting system was upgraded, and the spread of light reached 12.4 miles. In 1873, the construction resumed along with cleaning efforts of the surrounding areas. The building was finished and painted white. In 1876, an additional telegraph spot was built near the tower. | <small>storehouse purposes | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">storage needs</span> |
| <small>3 | <small>Eva held ambitions to replace Hortensio Quijano for the 1951 election, although her poor health kept her from this. Nonetheless many were concerned that her agenda would be pushed through. In march of 1951 the government arrested several retired army officers due to their dissent and disapproval of Perón’s administration. This raised tensions among the rest of the army, although action did not occur. By September tensions had risen among the military due to the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">unrivalled power</span> of the Peronist regime. On September 28, 1951, during the election, Menéndez led the military uprising in an attempt to overthrow the government. He led a core of officers, commanding a division, and left Campo de Mayo bound for the Casa Rosada. Resolve for the uprising, especially among the non-commissioned officers and enlisted men, was not strong enough. They were not prepared to fight their own countrymen. The uprising was over as soon as opposition was encountered, almost completely bloodless. Perón admired the loyalty of the troops and pardoned all those involved. <br/><br/> The design uses a similar standard to the JVX in terms of distortion reduction with crossbraces and 27 cells but that’s where the similarity ends. Petra was built from the ground up with entirely new panel shaping and trim. Petra has a highly elliptical planform and very high sweep. NZ Aerosports say she has a high roll rate, a long recovery arc and high maximal glide ratio. She is said to deliver <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unrivalled power</span> in the turn, plane out and flare. Petra has a long list of World Records, National and International titles to back that up. She had an impressive debut at the PD Big Boy Pants event in July 2011, with Nick Batsch setting a new distance world record of 222.45m (729ft). One month later Nick took out the Pink Open in Klatovy and the FAI World Cup also; first in distance, speed and overall. He also won the 2011 US CP nationals on Petra. Patrick Boulongne came 2nd in the European Championships and 6th overall at the World Cup with Petra in his first competition with her. He went on to win the 2011 French Canopy Piloting Nationals. | <small>incomparable energy | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unrivalled power</span> |
| <small>4 | <small>In addition, the results from the study did not support the idea of females preferring complexity over simplicity in song sequences. These findings differ from <span style="background-color: #00FF00">past examinations</span>, like the 2008 Morisake et al. study that suggested evidence of female Bengalese finches preferring complex songs over simple ones. Evolutionary adaptations of specifically complex song production in relation to female preference in Bengalese finches continues to be a topic worth examining. Comparison with zebra finches. Bengalese finches and zebra finches are members of the estrildiae family and are age-limited learners when it comes to song learning and the acoustic characteristics of their songs (Peng et al., 2012). Both of these species have been widely used in song learning based animal behavior research and although they share many characteristics researchers have been able to determine stark differences between the two. Previous to research done in 1987, it was thought that song learning in Bengalese finches was similar to zebra finches but there was no research to support this idea. Both species require learning from an adult during a sensitive juvenile phase in order to learn the species specific and sexually dimorphic songs. This tutor can be the father of the young or other adult males that are present around the juvenile. Clayton aimed to directly compare the song learning ability of both of these species to determine if they have separate learning behaviors.<br/><br/>Many students find they can not possibly complete all the work assigned them; they learn to neglect some of it. Some student groups maintain files of <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">past examinations</span> which only worsen this situation. The difference between the formal and real requirements produced considerable dissonance among the students and resulted in cynicism, scorn, and hypocrisy among students, and particular difficulty for minority students. No part of the university community, writes Snyder, neither the professors, the administration nor the students, desires the end result created by this process. The "Saturday Review" said the book "will gain recognition as one of the more cogent 'college unrest' books" and that it presents a "most provocative thesis." The book has been cited many times in studies. References.

| <small>5 | <small>Some divers are allergic to latex, and should avoid latex seals. Dry suits can be effective for protection against exposure to a wide range of hazardous materials, and the choice of suit material should take into account its resistance to the known contaminants. Hazmat diving often requires complete isolation of the diver from the environment, necessitating the use of dry glove systems and helmets sealed directly to the suit. Hot water suits. Hot water suits are usually made in one piece of foamed neoprene with a zipper on the front of the torso and on the lower part of each leg, and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design, and need not be very thick, as their primary function is to temporarily retain and guide the flow of the heating water. The wrists and ankles of the suit must allow water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface. Gloves and boots are worn which receive hot water from the ends of the arm and leg hoses. If a full-face mask is worn, the hood may be supplied by a tube at the neck of the suit. Helmets do not require heating. Breathing gas can be heated at the helmet by using a hot water shroud over the helmet inlet piping between the valve block and the regulator, which reduces heat loss to the breathing gas. Hot water suits are often used for <span style="background-color: #00FF00">deep dives</span> when breathing mixes containing helium are used.<br/><br/>Legal Evening News or "Fazhi Wanbao"(), also known as The Mirror or Legal Evening Post, was a Beijing-based legal affairs newspaper published in the People's Republic of China in simplified Chinese. Its predecessor was the "Beijing Legal News" (北京法制报), which was sponsored by the Judicial and Law Enforcement Committee of Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China (中国共产党北京市委员会政法委员会). "Legal Evening News" was a China's state-run newspaper, which was officially inaugurated on May 18, 2004. It was published by the Legal Evening Post Agency (法制晚报社), and was shut down by the Government of China on January 1, 2019. History. At the end of 2003, "Beijing Youth Daily" acquired the "Beijing Legal News", and relaunched it under the title of "Legal Evening News" on May 18, 2004. On April 29, 2005, fawan.com, the official website of "Legal Evening News", was created.

| <small>6 | <small>Challenge square dance, also known as Challenge dancing, is modern western square dance focused on the puzzle-solving aspects of square dancing at the most difficult or "challenging" levels. In modern square dancing, the dancers interpret the caller's directions (calls) to determine whom to act with, where to go, and how to get there. All square dancers learn standard "definitions" of calls, which they recall and use when the caller issues a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">given command</span>. Most square dancers learn about 100 calls. Challenge dancing involves many more calls, and the definitions and choreographic combinations are more abstract and difficult to process. The same physical movements (e.g. arm turns, passing by) are employed, but deciphering the complex commands and figuring out what you're supposed to do is much more challenging.

After attending the Army Staff College, he was appointed training officer of No. 84 Group RAF based in Celle, Germany on 27 November 1946. Carey returned to England in 1947 to divorce his first wife and marry army nurse Bertha Kathleen Walters Jones, known as Kate. They married on 18 December 1947 in Stockton-On-Tees. On 9 January 1948 he was posted back to Germany in <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">given command</span> of the Hawker Tempest 135 Wing at RAF Gütersloh. At this base Carey recorded his 2,000th flying hour. Carey also competed in air racing, organised by the RAF flying the de Havilland Vampire. In February 1949 Carey was appointed wing commander (administration) at RAF Thorney Island. On 18 August 1949 he was appointed wing commander (organisation) at No. 12 Group RAF, Fighter Command before being wing commander (operations) in Scotland on 2 July 1951. | <small>certain directive | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">given command</span> |
| <small>7 | <small>The usual symptoms are pain and swelling of the affected salivary gland, both of which get worse when salivary flow is stimulated, e.g. with the sight, thought, smell or taste of food, or with hunger or chewing. This is often termed "mealtime syndrome". Inflammation or infection of the gland may develop as a result. Sialolithiasis may also develop because of the presence of existing chronic infection of the glands, dehydration (e.g. use of phenothiazines), Sjögren's syndrome and/or increased <span style="background-color: #00FF00">local levels</span> of calcium, but in many instances the cause is idiopathic (unknown). The condition is usually managed by removing the stone, and several different techniques are available. Rarely, removal of the submandibular gland may become necessary in cases of recurrent stone formation. Sialolithiasis is common, accounting for about 50% of all disease occurring in the major salivary glands and causing symptoms in about 0.45% of the general population. Persons aged 30–60 and males are more likely to develop sialolithiasis. Classification.<br/><br/>Owing to this membership decline, accelerated recruitment efforts were targeted at youth and factory workers for the rest of the 1970s. The party's membership efforts in the 1980s focused on recruiting politically and professionally qualified people willing to exercise greater activism in implementing the party's program. Party leaders at the 17th Party Congress (1986) urged recruitment of more workers, young people, and women. In 1981 it had 1,538,179 members (10% of the population) KSČ membership was contingent upon completion of a one year period as a candidate member. Candidate members could not vote or be elected to party committees. In addition to candidates for party membership, there were also candidates for party leadership groups from the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">local levels</span> to the Presidium. These candidates, already party members, were considered interns training for the future assumption of particular leadership responsibilities. Training of members. Indoctrination and training of party members was one of the basic responsibilities of regional and district organizations, and party training was mostly conducted on these levels. Regional and district units worked with local party organizations in setting up training programs and determining which members would be enrolled in particular courses of study. On the whole, the system of party schooling changed little since it was established in 1949. | <small>nearby amounts | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">local levels</span> |
| <small>8 | <small>The red-figure technique was likely perfected, if not created, by the Andokides painter. This revolutionary technique made the compositions stand out more so they were easier to see from a distance. It essentially used the same materials as the black-figure, but reversed the way the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">image figures</span> were created. Instead of using incision and added light colors to define figures, figures were left with light glaze then defined with black lines while the background was filled in black. This contrast of light on dark made the composition stand out as opposed to the dark, shadowy figures on a black-figure composition. This created a need, however, for even more decorations along the top, bottom, and sides of the main register in order to delineate the black of the vase from the black background of the figural scene. The introduction of the red-figure technique can be related back to the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi. The style of the Andokides painter is remarkably similar to the sculptural decorations on the treasury. This similarity can be traced through the particular details in armory and human anatomy, the use of drapery lines, and also through the subject of the struggle for the Delphic tripod. According to Dietrich von Bothmer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, only the Andokides painter has been known to emphasize calf muscles with three curved lines as is also seen on the frieze of the Siphnian Treasury. This relation shows that the Andokides painter was inspired by the sculptural decorations on the treasury and incorporated aspects of that into his own works.<br/><br/>A Time magazine article claimed in 1940 that 75 percent of the handsaws sold in the U.S. were made by Disston. West of the railroad, Disston built a paternalistic industrial village which has been the subject of books, academic studies, and Papal and government recognition. Disston is still regarded with reverence in the community and his <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">image figures</span> prominently on a large community mural. Tacony thrived during the industrial age as national and international firms opened branches there. The Tacony Iron Company manufactured the dome of Philadelphia City Hall and the massive statue of William Penn that it supports. In 1894, Frank Shuman, inventor of wire glass and a pioneer in solar power twice featured on the cover of Scientific American built a large inventor's compound on Disston Street and there built the first solar-powered steam engine. From experiments conducted there, he later developed solar-powered steam turbines to irrigate land in Egypt. Tacony Palmyra Bridge. The Tacony-Palmyra Bridge, one of only two Delaware River spans connecting New Jersey with northeast Philadelphia (the other being the Betsy Ross Bridge further downstream), has its Pennsylvania terminus in Tacony. The bridge, which carries Pennsylvania Route 73, connects with New Jersey Route 73 in Palmyra, New Jersey. It opened in 1929, eliminating the need for ferries, used on that route since 1922. | <small>being is featured | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">image figures</span> |
| <small>9 | <small>According to a group representing the plaintiffs, the deal has no <span style="background-color: #00FF00">specific cap</span>; BP estimated that it would pay approximately $7.8 billion. BP says that it has $9.5 billion in assets set aside in a trust to pay the claims, and the settlement will not increase the $37.2 billion the company budgeted for spill-related expenses. Individual claimants would not be required to agree to the settlement, but experts estimate that such claims would be insignificant. By December 2013, BP had paid nearly $13 billion in claims to businesses, individuals and the government. Not included in the settlement are claims by US states and federal fines. David Uhlmann, a lawyer who has served Justice Department's environmental crime section, believed the settlement of private claims will facilitate a deal between BP and the various governmental departments being reached. Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. agreed. On August 13, BP asked US District Judge Carl Barbier to approve the settlement, saying its actions "did not constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct". Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, a company responsible is liable for only $75 million in economic damages, provided it did not exhibit "gross negligence" and the federal government picks up the next $1 billion. In response to the BP filing and in order to ensure that BP could not use its filing and any possible acceptance of the settlement to escape a judgement of gross negligence, on August 31, 2012, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) filed papers describing the spill as an example of "gross negligence and willful misconduct". The government also advised that Judge Barbier should disregard claims made by BP that minimize the environmental and economic impacts of the spill.<br/><br/>CAP are routing information for all the Italian cities and towns which have just a single CAP each; 28 city centres have a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">specific cap</span>. Vatican City and San Marino also use the Italian postal code system. Italian CAP postal codes have an optional prefix of "I-" (or "IT-", or none at all, depending on where the mail originates) followed by five digits. The region name is not used in the postal address, but the "provincia" is included as the 2-letter abbreviation of the province's capital. Thus, a Mario Rossi living on Via Giuseppe Garibaldi, 10 in the town of Buccinasco in the province of Milan will be addressed as follows: The town of Buccinasco is in the province of Milan (MI); the region (Lombardy) is not included in the address. Note also the surname is generally written before the first name  The 2-letter abbreviation of the provincial capital is usually not included in addresses for large towns characterised by multi-CAP in their city centres. Thus, a Mario Rossi living at Via Dante, 10 in the city of Rome in the province of Rome will be addressed as follows: Neither the province of Rome (RM) nor the region (Lazio) is included in the address. List of postal codes in Italy (including Vatican City and San Marino). (*) In Sardinia in 2005, 4 new provinces were created (and the borders of existing provinces modified). The CAP of 2006 approved new provincial prefixes for postal codes in the affected areas but did not modify the existing numeric suffixes of the postal codes.

| <small>10 | <small>In the case of a utility blackout in a grid-connected PV system, the solar panels will continue to deliver power as long as the sun is shining. In this case, the supply line becomes an "island" with power surrounded by a "sea" of unpowered lines. For this reason, solar inverters that are designed to supply power to the grid are generally required to have automatic anti-islanding circuitry in them. In intentional islanding, the generator disconnects from the grid, and forces the distributed generator to power the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">local circuit</span>. This is often used as a power backup system for buildings that normally sell their power to the grid.

| <small>11 | <small>It is not possible to increase the resolution of the basic dual-slope ADC to arbitrarily high values by using longer measurement times or faster clocks. Resolution is limited by: Enhancements. The basic design of the dual-slope integrating ADC has a limitations in linearity, conversion speed and resolution. A number of modifications to the basic design have been made to overcome these to some degree. Run-up improvements. Enhanced dual-slope. The run-up phase of the basic dual-slope design integrates the input voltage for a fixed period of time. That is, it allows an unknown amount of charge to build up on the integrator's capacitor. The run-down phase is then used to measure this <span style="background-color: #00FF00">unknown charge</span> to determine the unknown voltage. For a full-scale input equal to the reference voltage, half of the measurement time is spent in the run-up phase. Reducing the amount of time spent in the run-up phase can reduce the total measurement time.<br/><br/>Rabbeinu Chananel trained Alfasi to deduce and to clarify the Halakha from Talmudic sources, and Alfasi then conceived of the idea of compiling a comprehensive work that would present all of the practical conclusions of the Gemara in a clear, definitive manner. To achieve this goal, he worked for ten consecutive years in his father-in-law's attic. In 1045, Alfasi moved to Fez with his wife and two children. (However, Binyamin Ze'ev Benedict and other recent scholars argue that Alfasi was never active in Fez.) Fez's Jewish community undertook to support him and his family so that he could work on his "Sefer Ha-halachot" undisturbed. They also founded a yeshiva in his honor, and many students throughout Morocco came to study under his guidance. The most famous of his many students is Rabbi Judah Halevi, author of the Kuzari; he also taught Rabbi Joseph ibn Migash (the "Ri Migash"), who was in turn a teacher of Rabbi Maimon, father and teacher of Maimonides "(Rambam)". Alfasi remained in Fez for 40 years, during which time he completed his "Sefer Ha-halachot".

| <small>13 | <small>In 1960, the "outer seven" (Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) established the European Free Trade Association in Stockholm, which entered into force on 3 May of that year. In the following two years, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark and Norway applied for membership of the Communities, while the neutral countries Austria, Sweden and Switzerland asked for economic association agreements. <span style="background-color: #00FF00">membership application</span> was suspended due to opposition from then-French President Charles de Gaulle to British membership, seeing it as a Trojan horse for US influence. Another crisis was triggered in regard to proposals for the financing of the Common Agricultural Policy, which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity had come to an end, and majority-voting in the council had taken effect. De Gaulle's opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an "empty chair policy" whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the Luxembourg compromise on 29 January 1966 whereby a gentlemen's agreement permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest. Merger Treaty. On 24 September 1963 the members reached an agreement on merging the executive bodies of the three Communities. A year later it is agreed the single "Commission" would have nine members: two from each of the larger states, France, Germany and Italy, and one from each of the smaller Benelux states: Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg. The Merger Treaty was signed on 8 April 1965 and entered into force on 1 July 1967 merging all three Communities with common institutions.<br/><br/>Waterside Karori association football club founded when Karori Swifts and Waterside (a club based in Kaiwharawhara) merged. Karori Historical Society. Karori Historical Society is one of many historical societies of Aotearoa New Zealand, <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">membership application</span> is open to all residents and citizens of New Zealand. The activities include publishing books about the history of Karori and there are many titles listed on their website for example "Karori and its People" and "Karori Streets 1841–1991." The book "Karori Streets" was updated in 2019 and is about the European settlement of the suburb. Original authors are Will Chapman and historian Katherine (Kitty) Wood who was born in 1912. Judith Burch is the president of Karori historical society and co-author of the book, "Karori and its People." The other author is Jan Heynes, also the vice president of the society. Heynes has family connections in Karori from in the early 1900s through the Kirkcaldie family. Facilities.

In 1958, the running track was removed, making space for a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">bigger field</span>. New stands are built as well, increasing the capacity to 22,000. Four 40-meter high floodlights were installed by Philips in the stadium in the same year, making evening matches possible. The lights were inaugurated on April 9 with an exhibition match against RSC Anderlecht. A complete renovation of the stadium started in 1969. After its completion in 1977, the stadium was completely enclosed and every seat was covered. The main (south) stand peaked above the other stands. The capacity rose to 26,500, of which 12,000 were for standing spectators. The renovated ground was celebrated with a match against Leeds United. Earlier, the ground was used by the Netherlands national football team for the first time.<br/><br/>Anthecology, or pollination biology, is the study of pollination as well as the relationships between flowers and their pollinators. Floral biology is a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">bigger field</span> that includes these studies. Most flowering plants, or angiosperms, are pollinated by animals, and especially by insects. The major flower-frequenting insect taxa include beetles, flies, wasps, bees, ants, thrips, butterflies, and moths. Insects carry out pollination when visiting flowers to obtain nectar or pollen, to prey on other species, or when pseudo-copulating with insect-mimicking flowers such as orchids. Pollination-related interactions between plants and insects are considered mutualistic, and the relationships between plants and their pollinators have likely led to increased diversity of both angiosperms and the animals that pollinate them. Anthecology brings together many disciplines, such as botany, horticulture, entomology, and ecology. History. Anthecology began as a descriptive science relying on observation, and more recently has come to rely upon quantitative and experimental studies. By the 17th century, the sexual nature of plant reproduction was recognized following the work of Nehemiah Grew and the experiments of Rudolf Jakob Camerarius, who showed that pistillate plants need both male and female organs for reproduction. Tulips and maize were popular subjects of study during this time. | <small>larger open land | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">bigger field</span> |
| <small>16 | <small>The Neo-vedantists, who strove to present Hinduism as a "homogenized ideal of Hinduism" and the Arya-samajists rejected this contention. In the context of Hindu philosophy, this term occurs very significantly in the Second śloka (verse) of Sri Shankara’s Vivekachudamani which śloka reads as follows:- The purport of this statement is that all three twice-born castes are qualified to study the Vedas but attaining the status of "viprata" - that of being a Brāhmana, is very rare. Whereas a Kshatriya engages himself mostly in ruling over his kingdom and a Vaishya, in trade etc; the person of a Brāhmana, because it is not intended for enjoying sense-pleasures, must be subjected to strict disciplines in preparation of enjoying eternal joy in store after death, the ultimate "vaiśnavam padam" which is the dharma only of Brāhmaņas. Through a Sanskrit inscription, written in late Brahmi script, found on the Talagunda Stone-pillar in Shimoga district dated 455-470 A.D; it became known that a Kadamba king named Śāntivarman had saved the Brahmanahood in the "Kali Yuga". In his commentary on the Aitareya Upanishad (Sloka III.ii.3), Shankara states that the "Atman" is expanded only in human beings who are therefore endowed with intelligence; who see what is known, give expression to what is known and know what is to come; they know the visible and the invisible and perceive the immortal through the mortal. Thus, according to Shankara, the individual self is conscious living entity that makes the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">individual body</span> eligible for action and knowledge. Accordingly, the term "Viprata", here, refers to the inwardly inspired or awakened body and mind; it does not refer to persons born in the families of Brahmins as has been erroneously interpreted by the orthodox interpreters. Śrī Candraśekhara Bhāratī of Śringeri in his commentary explains that the phrase - तस्माद्वैदिक-धर्ममार्गपरता in the afore-cited verse refers to him who is inclined to the path of dharma prescribed in the Vedas; and he alone who is an "āstika", the one who believes in the existence of the atman apart from the body, is qualified to study the "Vedānta Śāstra". And, this means that mere "viprata" (birth as a brahmin) by itself will not help to attain what is to be attained, and vide Jaimini Dharma, which is super-sensuous and the very foundation of universe, is what is commanded by the Vedas. The phrase आत्मानात्मविवेचनं refers to the discrimination between the "Atman" and whatever is not the "Atman", that is, to the "Anatman", which reflection produces firm conviction of the truth of the śrutis supported by reasoning. "Dig Darśani" of Sanātana Gosvami tells us that "Viprata" i.e.<br/><br/>The research was based on the datasets for Southern Chinese contract migrants who were sent to Suriname and Indonesia and included 13,000 individuals. Measuring instruments. 3D body scanners. Today anthropometry can be performed with three-dimensional scanners. A global collaborative study to examine the uses of three-dimensional scanners for health care was launched in March 2007. The Body Benchmark Study will investigate the use of three-dimensional scanners to calculate volumes and segmental volumes of an <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">individual body</span> scan. The aim is to establish whether the Body Volume Index has the potential to be used as a long-term computer-based anthropometric measurement for health care. In 2001 the UK conducted the largest sizing survey to date using scanners. Since then several national surveys have followed in the UK's pioneering steps, notably SizeUSA, SizeMexico, and SizeThailand, the latter still ongoing. SizeUK showed that the nation had become taller and heavier but not as much as expected. Since 1951, when the last women's survey had taken place, the average weight for women had gone up from 62 to 65 kg. | <small>human physical structure | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">individual body</span> |
| <small>17 | <small>He takes time to observe the furniture, art work, and architecture of his new residence, as well as the exteriors of the other residential buildings throughout the neighborhood. Overall, he rather likes his new environment. During his first night in the house he comes across a book in his room entitled, "Mary Todd Lincoln: Her Life and Letters". The work consists of numerous letters written by the former first lady after the death of her husband. The narrator relates deeply to the grief Mary Todd Lincoln expresses throughout the pages of the text. After her husband died, she no longer had a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">stable home</span>; she simply wandered the world in a permanent state of mourning. The narrator continuously reads this book throughout the novel; comparing Mary Todd Lincoln's suffering to that of his own. During his first few days alone in the house, he encounters numerous interesting locals around N Street. He meets a homeless man who works as a con-artist, telling people he needs money to take his nonexistent wife to the hospital. He also notices the handsome, yet reclusive, military veteran who cleans leaves off the sidewalk and receives helpful advice from the homosexual couple who live in the townhouse beneath him. The landlord soon returns from his business trip and introduces himself to the narrator.<br/><br/>Longer races start in the homestretch, take one turn into the backstretch, then another turn into the homestretch, so may be called "two turn" races. Depending on the track dimensions, very long races may consist of three turns, starting on the backstretch and then making a full lap and more. Stabling area. Backstretch is also used to refer to the stabling area adjacent to the racetrack. A backstretch is divided into several areas. One, known as "shed row", is a line of stables, each <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">stable home</span> to many of the horses at the track. There are also dormitories, where workers (many migrant) live; offices for the trainers to register horses for upcoming races; a cafeteria; a recreation hall; and offices for the Chaplain. People working in this area are sometimes described as "the backstretch family", consisting of trainers, exercise riders, jockeys, grooms, farriers, veterinarians, muckers, jockey agents, and others in various positions. One groom explained the daily routine: "I come in about four-thirty. Feed breakfast. Most people have watchers [who observe a horse to make sure it is eating well and shows no signs of illness] when they feed breakfast. | <small>sturdy household | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">stable home</span> |
| <small>18 | <small>This veteran organization had fought its way across Europe from Normandy to the Schnee Eifel. In the process, it had occupied the German fortifications of the "Westwall" and set up fortifications to hold the ridgeline of the Eifel. In order to free-up the 2nd Division for the attack, its place in the defensive line was to be taken over by the newly arrived 106th Infantry Division. The 106th Division began replacing the 2nd Infantry Division in the area of St. Vith and the Schnee Eifel on 10 December 1944. Despite the wishes of Major General Walter Melville Robertson, commander of the 2nd Division, the 106th Division would also be deployed for an attack eastward, with most of its force isolated on the Schnee Eifel. In addition, in order not to alert the Germans of the change in divisions, the 106th could not bring any equipment forward and had to rely on equipment left behind by the 2nd Division. The 106th Division came out worse in this deal, for the 2nd had picked up extra communications gear, weapons, and vehicles in the course of its travels across Europe for which the 106th had no equivalent, so the 2nd took most of their equipment with them. The 106th had also suffered significant personnel changes, since sixty percent of its troop strength had been used to make up for higher than expected losses in units already in Europe. These losses had been made up from troops taken from disbanded small units, air cadets in training, and divisions not moving immediately to Europe. The effect of disruptions in organization, training, and equipment made the division relatively ineffective as a combat unit. The American high command believed that the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">static nature</span> of the Ardennes area would allow time for the 106th to correct its deficiencies.<br/><br/>It generates static pages, but does not manage hosting.

| <small>19 | <small>Leno has faced heated criticism and some negative publicity for his <span style="background-color: #00FF00">perceived role</span> in the 2010 "Tonight Show" conflict. Critics have pointed to a 2004 "Tonight Show" clip, in which Leno said he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident. At the time, Leno stated he did not want O'Brien to leave for a competing network, adding, "I'll be 59 when [the switch occurs], that's five years from now. There's really only one person who could have done this into his 60s, and that was Johnny Carson; I think it's fair to say I'm no Johnny Carson." Leno also described "The Tonight Show" as a dynasty, saying, "You hold it and hand it off to the next person. And I don't want to see all the fighting." At the end of the segment, he said, "Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!" Rosie O'Donnell was among O'Brien's most vocal and vehement supporters, calling Leno a "bully" and his actions "classless and kind of career-defining". Bill Zehme, the co-author of Leno's autobiography "Leading with My Chin", told the "Los Angeles Times", "The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back.<br/><br/>For many years it was assumed that the Royal Navy flat-irons were a failure at their <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">perceived role</span> of coastal defence. Professor Andrew Lambert later argued powerfully that they were designed for coastal assault as successors to the gunboats of the Crimean War "Great Armament", and that they succeeded in their deterrent role. He describes them as a "part of a sophisticated, layered approach to the tactical problem of defeating large-scale coastal defence systems." The Royal Navy listed them as "Gunboats for the Attack and Defence of Coasts" in its confidential Pink List. Due to their lack of speed and limited armament they were of little value in defence of a coast or harbour, but they were ideally suited for bombardment of shore fortifications where the Royal Navy enjoyed complete command of the sea. "Staunch" and "Plucky" were essentially prototypes built in 1867 and 1870. "Handy" and "Drudge" were built in the 1880s for testing the mounting of 13.5-inch guns intended for the "Royal Sovereign"-class battleships. The "Medina" class were a development of the flat-iron concept which resulted in an iron coastal gunboat fitted with three masts and carrying three 6.3-inch 64-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns. Naval historian Anthony Preston described them as "the most grotesque craft ever seen".

| <small>21 | <small>A child’s first "why" question often coincides with their first attempt to explain something, within the first year after acquiring language. Children ask "why" to understanding mechanism and causality. The ability to understand and reason about causality at a young age allows children to develop naïve theories about many topics. Causality helps children learn about physics, language, concepts and the behavior of others. There is a developmental pattern to the causal understanding children have. Infants have an understanding of causal power. They know that certain causes have particular effects. Young children, from late infancy to early childhood, understand functional relations: a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">particular property</span> (or component of a mechanism) has a certain function. They also understand causal density: how causes can interact in a complex way. Older children and adults continue to develop an understanding of mechanistic fragments. They understand the components of a working system in isolation, although the full mechanistic details of a system do not emerge until adulthood.<br/><br/>The main auditorium is located on a former 1882 religious camp meeting sanctuary that was extensively altered in 1925-26 to accommodate the theater. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history. The Lakewood Theater complex is set on the western shore of Lake Wesserunsett, off United States Route 201 in eastern Madison. The main theater building is a 2-1/2 story Colonial Revival wood frame structure with a gable roof. A two-story porch extends across much of the front, with square paneled posts and diamond-pattern balustrade. The property on which the theater is built was part of a larger resort area developed by owners of the area's trolley car network to draw people to use their facilities. This <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">particular property</span> was where in 1882 a religious camp meeting sanctuary was built, which forms the core of the theater building. In 1884 this building was converted into a skating rink, and in 1898 its use as a theater began. The theater's rise in prominence began in 1901, when Herbert Swett took over its management, and oversaw improvements to its physical plant over a 20-year tenure. By the mid-1920s, when the building achieved its present form, the theater was a major tryout location for Broadway shows. | <small>specific component | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">particular property</span> |
| <small>22 | <small>Criteria for a cleansing agent. Wound cleansing forms an integral part of wound management and generally suggests the application of a fluid to aid the removal of surface contaminants, bacteria and debris from the wound surface and surrounding skin. Water as a cleansing agent, especially in chronic wounds has been proposed and is widely used especially in the management of infected wounds. Despite the plethora of work focussing on the value of water/saline in wound cleansing there is no current consensus as to whether water has an active role to play in the promotion of healing. With this <span style="background-color: #00FF00">unclear position</span> in mind, alternative cleansing agents such as antiseptics that possess the potential to improve clinical outcomes should be considered. The use of antiseptics on open wounds is justified in terms of prevention / treatment of infection and improved healing outcomes. Criteria by which a wound cleansing agent could be deemed suitable for use on wounds include: There is scant evidential provision in respect of guidance as to the optimal wound cleanser. In general, recommendations for practice are based on consensus opinion often derived from clinical experience and in vitro and/or in vivo studies. Biofilm infection. Attaching to a surface is a natural association for bacteria in the wild. Biofilm phenotype bacteria are microbial communities that are attached to a surface and are embedded in an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) consisting of proteins, glycoproteins, nucleic acids (RNA, DNA) and polysaccharides (slime).<br/><br/>4.h4: Kieseritzky Gambit and Allgaier Gambit. The Kieseritzky Gambit, 4.h4 g4 5.Ne5, is considered by modern writers such as Shaw and Gallagher to be the main line after 3...g5. It was popularized by Lionel Kieseritzky in the 1840s and used successfully by Wilhelm Steinitz. Boris Spassky used it to beat Bobby Fischer in a famous game at Mar del Plata in 1960. The main line of the Kieseritzky Gambit is considered to be 5...Nf6 6.Bc4 d5 7.exd5 Bd6 8.d4 with an <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unclear position</span>. 4.h4 g4 5.Ng5 is the Allgaier Gambit, intending 5...h6 6.Nxf7. This knight sacrifice is considered unsound. 4.Bc4 g4: Muzio Gambit and others. The extremely Muzio Gambit arises after 4.Bc4 g4 5.0-0 gxf3 6.Qxf3, where White has sacrificed a knight but has three pieces bearing down on f7. Such wild play is rare in modern chess, but Black must defend accurately. Perhaps the sharpest continuation is the Double Muzio after 6...Qf6 7.e5 Qxe5 8.Bxf7+, leaving White two pieces down in eight moves, but with a position that some masters consider to be equal. | <small>imprecise spot | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">unclear position</span> |

| <small>24 | <small>If the lens is biconvex or plano-convex, a collimated beam of light passing through the lens converges to a spot (a "focus") behind the lens. In this case, the lens is called a "positive" or "converging" lens. For a thin lens in air, the distance from the lens to the spot is the focal length of the lens, which is commonly represented by "f" in diagrams and equations. An extended hemispherical lens is a special type of plano-convex lens, in which the lens's curved surface is a full hemisphere and the lens is much thicker than the radius of curvature. If the lens is biconcave or plano-concave, a collimated beam of light passing through the lens is diverged (spread); the lens is thus called a "negative" or "diverging" lens. The beam, after passing through the lens, appears to emanate from a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">particular point</span> on the axis in front of the lens. For a thin lens in air, the distance from this point to the lens is the focal length, though it is negative with respect to the focal length of a converging lens. Convex-concave (meniscus) lenses can be either positive or negative, depending on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces. A "negative meniscus" lens has a steeper concave surface and is thinner at the centre than at the periphery. Conversely, a "positive meniscus" lens has a steeper convex surface and is thicker at the centre than at the periphery. An ideal thin lens with two surfaces of equal curvature would have zero optical power, meaning that it would neither converge nor diverge light.<br/><br/>It originally aired on October 20, 1961 on CBS. Plot. In a Central American dictatorship, Ramos Clemente and his four lifelong confidants, D'Alessandro, Garcia, Tabal, and Cristo, stage a successful revolution against the regime of General De Cruz. Clemente faces down De Cruz and revels in his victory, but the deposed general says that Clemente will soon learn the consequences of ruling by force and that his ornate mirror has the ability to reveal enemies in its reflection, though Clemente dismisses the latter. When Clemente begins using the same repressive tactics used by De Cruz, a rift develops between him and his friends, now government heads. A <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">particular point</span> of contention is Clemente's order for mass executions of prisoners he has declared to be enemies of the state. When Clemente looks into the mirror, he sees visions implying that all four of his confidantes are plotting to assassinate him. Clemente believes that the mirror reflects their true thoughts and accuses them of their supposed future crimes. In spite of their denials, he kills two himself and ordering the other two killed by his men. Sometime later, Clemente is approached by a priest named Father Tomas, who asks him to end the executions. Clemente refuses, saying that as long as he has enemies, the executions will continue. | <small>certain mark | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">particular point</span> |
| <small>25 | <small>He writes that it would be "useful and important to distinguish between types of spirits and apparitions. Until then it's merely a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">parlor game</span> distracting amateur ghost hunters from the task at hand." According to research in anomalistic psychology visions of ghosts may arise from hypnagogic hallucinations ("waking dreams" experienced in the transitional states to and from sleep). In a study of two experiments into alleged hauntings (Wiseman "et al". 2003) came to the conclusion "that people consistently report unusual experiences in 'haunted' areas because of environmental factors, which may differ across locations." Some of these factors included "the variance of local magnetic fields, size of location and lighting level stimuli of which witnesses may not be consciously aware". Some researchers, such as Michael Persinger of Laurentian University, Canada, have speculated that changes in geomagnetic fields (created, e.g., by tectonic stresses in the Earth's crust or solar activity) could stimulate the brain's temporal lobes and produce many of the experiences associated with hauntings. Sound is thought to be another cause of supposed sightings. Richard Lord and Richard Wiseman have concluded that infrasound can cause humans to experience bizarre feelings in a room, such as anxiety, extreme sorrow, a feeling of being watched, or even the chills. Carbon monoxide poisoning, which can cause changes in perception of the visual and auditory systems, was speculated upon as a possible explanation for haunted houses as early as 1921. People who experience sleep paralysis often report seeing ghosts during their experiences.<br/><br/>Moreno and the other candidates were freed after the Manila Prosecutor's Office ruled that there was not enough evidence to prolong their detention.

The Andalusian barbel is quite abundant and not considered a threatened species by the IUCN, though locally populations may go extinct during summer droughts which isolate and dry up small creeks it inhabits. Habitat fragmentation, which is already affecting the species, is exacerbated by this.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is recommended that an advisory board begin with the advisory board leader, and grow from a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">fairly small size</span> to its ultimate number. Group dynamics suggests the maximum size for an advisory board is eight members, which takes into account of the need for enterprise people and other facilitators at meetings. Some advisory board's mandate may require more significant representation of a specific and large number of constituencies. Meeting organization and frequency. The functioning of an advisory board is affected significantly by how effectively the group's activities are organized and directed. A fixed meeting should be held regularly (monthly, annually or other) and advisory board members must be well informed of the purpose and background information of the meeting in order for them to provide valuable advice. A corollary should be provided to advisory board members, which should be of an appropriate length, organized, comprehensible and informative. While it should be concise, it should provide enough details to provide advisory board members a suitable foundation for them to advise on the business. Confidentiality of the information discussed in the meeting shall be considered. A skilled facilitator, administrator or corporate secretary is required to organize schedules of advisory board meetings and meeting materials. The facilitator or chair of the board should be committed and aware of time management for the meeting. | <small>somewhat low amount | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">fairly small size</span> |

A user of dipping tobacco will produce an <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">excess amount</span> of saliva which will be disposed of using a "spitter." A spitter can be an empty bottle, cup or commercially produced spittoon. Dipping tobacco use is often accompanied by first drinking a liquid, in some areas known as a primer, catalyst, and rinser. A primer is used to initially salivate the mouth, usually during a meal, in order to prepare the mouth to use smokeless tobacco. This is important because a dry mouth or one full of food could lead to a less enjoyable experience for the user. A catalyst, like a primer, is used to fix the issues of a dry mouth or dry tobacco; however, the dipping tobacco is already currently in the user's lip. A rinser is used when the user is finished with their tobacco, and it is swished around in the user's mouth, similar to mouthwash, to dispose of any excess tobacco juice or particulates.

| <small>28 | <small>Methamphetamine (contracted from ) is a potent central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and obesity. Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers: levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine. "Methamphetamine" properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is an <span style="background-color: #00FF00">equal mixture</span> of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms. It is rarely prescribed over concerns involving human neurotoxicity and potential for recreational use as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, among other concerns, as well as the availability of safer substitute drugs with comparable treatment efficacy. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine. Both methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use. The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia, Oceania, and in the United States, where racemic methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are classified as schedule II controlled substances.<br/><br/>Abbeydale, along with Batchley and Mayfields, were post-WWII 1950s housing estates built to cope with a population boom and the local councils enforcement of the Conservative government's 'Homes for Heroes' pledge after the 1951 United Kingdom general election.

| <small>29 | <small>The scheme proved to be controversial as the route of the completed road will bring heavy traffic through residential areas, also the route will bring heavy traffic through the centre of medieval Irishtown section of the city. The Central Access Scheme was officially opened on 23 May 2017. History. The Inner Relief Road was first proposed in 1978 as a means of providing access to brewery traffic to the brewery itself, which has since closed. Kilkenny city is currently surrounded by two thirds of a ring-road and the completion of this ring-road is seen by some as a greater priority for alleviating Kilkenny's traffic problems as they stand. Kilkenny County Council remained resolved that progress in the CAS project should continue ahead of completion to the outer ring road. Objectives. The Council’s objectives in providing the scheme were as follows: Route. The road commences at the Kilmanagh Road and passes northwards through a roundabout in the townland of Kilcreene. From Kilcreene, the CAS extends north eastwards to the Waterbarrack roundabout and along the existing Dean Street to St Canice’s Place (through medieval Irishtown). A new road was then built from the Kilmanagh road to the Waterbarrack, with <span style="background-color: #00FF00">another stem</span> going from the Kennyswell roundabout to the Freshford Road.<br/><br/>When any two vowels, or any three consonants that cannot occur as a phonological cluster, are combined due to morphological construction, the general tendency is for the second element to be eliminated. This is not true in the case of a laryngeal combining with a consonant cluster, in that order. In such a situation, the initial laryngeal element is eliminated. Morphology. Wiyot is a highly synthetic, agglutinative language. Words or, more specifically, accent phrases, are formed by joining stems and affixes. Wiyot employs both prefixation and suffixation, meaning that affixes appear both before and after stems. Both verb and noun forms are constructed this way, though the particulars of each system are different. Stems. Stems are non-affixal morphemes, and can appear individually or as compounds. For example, , meaning 'out', can appear as the only stem of a given word, or be joined to <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">another stem</span>, such as , 'go'. | <small>a different root | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">another stem</span> |
| <small>30 | <small>After terrible flooding inundated much of downtown Washington, D.C., in 1881, Congress ordered the United States Army Corps of Engineers to dredge a deep channel in the Potomac to lessen the chance of flooding. Congress also ordered that the dredged material be used to fill in what remained of the Tiber Creek estuary and build up much of the land near the White House and along Pennsylvania Avenue NW by nearly to form a kind of levee. This "reclaimed land" — which today includes West Potomac Park, East Potomac Park, the Tidal Basin — was largely complete by 1890, and designated Potomac Park by Congress in 1897. Congress first appropriated money for the beautification of the reclaimed land in 1902, which led to the planting of sod, bushes, and trees; grading and paving of sidewalks, bridle paths, and driveways; and the installation of water, drainage, and sewage pipes. But South B Street was not extended through the newly reclaimed land. In 1925, Congress authorized the construction of Arlington Memorial Bridge. The legislation specified that North B Street be treated as a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">major approach</span> to Arlington Memorial Bridge. The National Capital Park and Planning Commission approved the significant widening of North B Street into a ceremonial avenue. On February 25, 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed legislation which renamed North B Street as Constitution Avenue. Planning for the creation of a similar ceremonial avenue to take the place of South B Street began in 1930. That year, the National Capital Park and Planning Commission (NCPPC) advocated turning the roadway into a much-widened ceremonial avenue as a counterpart to North B Street.<br/><br/>Goal setting ensures that the client is already under stimulus control of the goal and is thus more likely to engage in behavior to achieve it. Behavior analytic programs are ultimately skill building, they enhance functioning, lead to higher quality of life, and build self-control. One of the most distinguishing features of behavior analysis has been its core belief that all individuals have a right to the most effective treatment for their condition. and a right to the most effective educational strategy available. History. Applied behavior analysis is the applied side of the experimental analysis of behavior. It is based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning and represents a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">major approach</span> to behavior therapies. Its origin can be traced back to Teodoro Ayllon and Jack Michael's 1959 article "The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer" as well as to initial efforts to implement teaching machines. The research basis of ABA can be found in the theoretical work of behaviorism and radical behaviorism originating with the work of B.F. Skinner. In 1968 Baer, Wolf and Risley wrote an article that was the source of contemporary applied behavior analysis providing the criteria to judge the adequacy of research and practice in applied behavior analysis. It became the core and centerpiece behavioral engineering. | <small>considerable convergence | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">major approach</span> |

On 13 May 2005, the Secretary of Defense recommended that Cannon Air Force Base be closed as part of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) process. However, on 25 August 2005, the BRAC Commission overturned the recommendation that Cannon AFB be closed, but upheld the withdrawal of the base's F-16 fighter aircraft. The Air Force had until 31 December 2009 to propose a new use for Cannon AFB, otherwise the base would be closed in 2010. Cannon AFB attempted to reopen a rejected EIS alternative, by substituting an Environmental Assessment. Comments were accepted through 4 October 2010. On 20 June 2006, it was announced that Cannon AFB would transfer from Air Combat Command and become an Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) installation. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">initial word</span> was that the 16th Special Operations Wing would transfer from Hurlburt Field, Florida. It was later decided that the 27th Fighter Wing would transfer from ACC to AFSOC and become the 27th Special Operations Wing. This action would entail expanding and realigning some aspects of both the 16th Special Operations Wing and Air Force Special Operations Command, also headquartered at Hurlburt Field. This designation means that the base will receive new aircraft to replace the F-16s lost in the BRAC realignment. | <small>primary term | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">initial word</span> |
| <small>32 | <small>Throughout 1965–1966 the castle was restored by the district of Nürtingen, now included in the district of Esslingen, under the supervision of the Baden-Württemberg Historical Monuments Department. Legend. A legend about the origins of the castle was written by Wilhelm Hauff. The legend states that the castle was founded by a giant who had lived in a cave on the opposite side of the valley. In order to arrive at the building site, the giant only had to cross the valley with one large step. However, he did not step far enough and was left with a foot stuck in the marshy valley floor. When he pulled his foot out again, a spring rose from the footprint, which created the Lindach river. Later, the castle was finished, except for one last nail. However, none of the craftsman dared to hammer in this <span style="background-color: #00FF00">final nail</span> at such a height. There was only one young craftsman from the Neidlingen valley who dared to try. The giant held the young man to the window over the abyss, until he had finished the work.<br/><br/>It is revealed that HimRaj is Organiser of GajKesari sect and is here to save Prithvi because it's their responsibility to look after wellbeing of GajKesari of that time.

| <small>33 | <small>This is because the pistons are moving in pairs, and one pair of pistons is always moving up at the same time as the other pair is moving down. However, straight-four engines have a secondary imbalance. This is caused by the acceleration/deceleration of the pistons during the top half of the crankshaft rotation being greater than that of the pistons in the bottom half of the crankshaft rotation (because the connecting rods are not infinitely long). As a result, two pistons are always accelerating faster in one direction, while the other two are accelerating more slowly in the other direction, which leads to a secondary dynamic imbalance that causes an up-and-down vibration at twice crankshaft speed. This imbalance is common among all piston engines, but the effect is particularly strong on inline-four because of the two pistons always moving together. The strength of this imbalance is determined by the reciprocating mass, the ratio of connecting rod length to stroke, and the peak piston velocity. Therefore, small displacement engines with light pistons show little effect, and racing engines use long connecting rods. However, the effect grows exponentially with engine speed (rpm).

Four-stroke engines with five or more cylinders are able to have at <span style="background-color: #00FF00">least one cylinder</span> performing its power stroke at any given point in time. However, four-cylinder engines have gaps in the power delivery, since each cylinder completes its power stroke before the next piston starts a new power stroke.<br/><br/>After returning to New Orleans he led his own band and played in the band of Norman Brownlee. Hardy's playing is described as being more lyrical than many of his New Orleans contemporaries, but with a driving rhythm. His tone was much admired. Hardy was an important influence on Bix Beiderbecke; Monk Hazel said that Bix on the Wolverines records sounds very much like Hardy. Hardy also did metal work, made his own mouthpieces for his horn, and modified his cornet to add an additional spit-valve. A relative remembered Hardy as being somewhat shy and unassuming, with a good dry sense of humor; that he was easily frightened by sudden loud noises, and superstitious about passing by graveyards. When advancing tuberculosis started to make his breathing difficult, Hardy taught himself banjo so he could continue playing music. Hardy and some of his musician friends made some home recordings on wax phonograph cylinders for their own amusement. As Hardy's tuberculosis worsened and his death seemed inevitable, the friends decided to preserve the cylinders as a memento of Hardy's playing. At <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">least one cylinder</span> survived to the start of the 1950s; the relative who heard it then said Hardy's playing reminded him of Sharkey Bonano.

| <small>34 | <small>In some Northern regions, the law was not implemented for a long time, keeping municipal utilities in place. In the Centre and the South, the Galli Law was implemented faster than in the North. Furthermore, the implementation of the Galli Law diverged from the original plan. For example, the boundaries of ATOs were supposed to be drawn based on various criteria including river basin boundaries, in line with the principles of integrated water resources management. However, in reality most boundaries of utilities were drawn along administrative boundaries. The 2000s: More privatization attempts. The second government of Silvio Berlusconi (2001-2006) tried to give a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">second push</span> to private sector participation. In 2001, it introduced norms that forced municipalities to award concessions to private companies, abolishing the direct award of concessions to public companies. However, faced with opposition, the norms were revised to allow direct “in-house” awards if it could be demonstrated that in-house provision was more efficient than a concession, or if utilities sold a majority share in their existing utilities. In the meantime, the foreign private companies that had entered the Italian water market in the late 1990s faced difficulties: "Foreign players including Thames Water and Saur attempted to enter the Italian market only to become embroiled in never-ending political, regulatory and legal wrangles". For example, in Arezzo, three years after the contract had been awarded in 1999, the local government asked a subsidiary of the French water company Suez to reduce its management fee because the planned financing had not been mobilized.<br/><br/>At 15:45, Moore ordered Alpha Company and Bravo Company to evacuate their casualties and pull back from engagement with the PAVN. Shortly after, Alpha and Bravo Companies began their advance from the creek bed toward 2nd Platoon, B Company and soon suffered casualties. At one point, B Company's advance was halted by a firmly entrenched PAVN machine-gun position at a large termite hill. Lt. Marm, 2nd Platoon, A Company, fired a light anti-tank weapon (LAW) at the machine-gun position, charged the position with grenades while under fire, and killed the remaining PAVN at the machine-gun position with rifle fire. The following day, a dozen dead PAVN troops (including one officer) were found in the position. Marm was wounded in the neck and jaw in the assault and was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his lone assault. The <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">second push</span> had advanced just over toward the lost platoon's position before being stopped by the PAVN. Alpha Company's 1st Platoon, leading the advance, was at risk of becoming separated from the battalion, and at one point it was being engaged by an American M60 machine gun that had been taken by the PAVN from a dead 2nd Platoon gunner. The impasse lasted between 20 and 30 minutes before Nadal (A Company) and Herren (B Company) requested permission to withdraw back to X-Ray (to which Moore agreed). Americans dig in for the night. Near 17:00, the lead elements of Bravo Company of 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry (2/7) arrived at LZ X-Ray to reinforce the embattled 1st Battalion; the company closed in at 18:00 hours. | <small>next attempt | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">second push</span> |
| <small>35 | <small>Palestinian refugees. Israel does not recognize a Palestinian Right of Return. Property that belonged to Arabs who left or fled Israel before, during and after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War is confiscated under the Absentee Property Act. Israel maintains that the General Assembly resolutions establishing the Right of Return are merely recommendations under International law, and in any event doubt that the refugees wish to "live in peace with their neighbors". Jewish Israelis fear that if Palestinian refugees were allowed to return to Israel, the Jews would become a minority and Israel would no longer be a Jewish state. Many believe that if surrounding Arab states integrate the Palestinian refugees hostilities could be defused, and that the harsh treatment of refugees in Arab states is done deliberately by those states in order to keep the conflict alive. Israel has stated that it is willing to allow a limited number of Arabs to immigrate on a humanitarian basis (such as the unification of families) and limited compensation for others in the framework of a comprehensive peace plan. Although serious discussion of how this would be implemented between both sides have yet to take place. The text of UN Resolution 194 refer to a "just settlement of the refugee problem" and does not specifically mention either the Palestinian refugees or the Jewish refugees, nor what a "just solution" would entail. Nevertheless, this resolution is the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">primary basis</span> for the concept of a "Right of Return" and is often referenced as if it were such. For example, in 2004, Resolution 59/117, the UN General Assembly "[n]otes with regret that repatriation or compensation of the refugees, as provided for in paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 194 (III), has not yet been effected and that, therefore, the situation of the Palestine refugees continues to be a matter of grave concern".<br/><br/>The 1-millimeter band is a portion of the EHF (microwave) radio spectrum internationally allocated to amateur radio and amateur satellite use. The band is between 241 GHz and 250 GHz.

| <small>36 | <small>Commercial Vehicle Operations is an application of Intelligent Transportation Systems for trucks. A <span style="background-color: #00FF00">typical system</span> would be purchased by the managers of a trucking company. It would have a satellite navigation system, a small computer and a digital radio in each truck. Every fifteen minutes the computer transmits where the truck has been. The digital radio service forwards the data to the central office of the trucking company. A computer system in the central office manages the fleet in real time under control of a team of dispatchers. In this way, the central office knows where its trucks are. The company tracks individual loads by using barcoded containers and pallets to track loads combined into a larger container. To minimize handling-expense, damage and waste of vehicle capacity, optimal-sized pallets are often constructed at distribution points to go to particular destinations. A good load-tracking system will help deliver more than 95% of its loads via truck, on planned schedules. If a truck gets off its route, or is delayed, the truck can be diverted to a better route, or urgent loads that are likely to be late can be diverted to air freight.<br/><br/>After a series of singles, the band's debut album, "Henge Beat", was released in August 2011. Their second album, "<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">typical system</span>", was released in June 2014. History. Total Control was formed in 2008 by Eddy Current Suppression Ring band member Mikey Young and UV Race's Dan Stewart. The pair, who came together over a shared interest of early 1980s acts such as Devo, Gary Numan, The Screamers, and The Adolescents, recorded some songs using a sampler and synthesizers at Young's home studio. They gained a following over the next few years after releasing a series of 7-inch singles and playing only a handful of live shows. Total Control became a quintet with the additions of guitarist Al Montfort, bassist Zephyr Pavey, and drummer James Vinciguerra. Young explained the reason for the expansion to "The Washington Post": "Bands with drum machines and three synths are just not as much fun to watch as bands with drummers and guitars," he said. "We realized it couldn't be good live, so we tried to adapt the songs to work in a rock-and-roll band." The band released their debut full-length album, "Henge Beat", in August 2011 on Seattle's Iron Lung Records. They went on a US tour with San Francisco-based band Thee Oh Sees, with whom they also released a split EP, and performed at the All Tomorrow's Parties music festival in Minehead, Somerset in December 2011. | <small>traditional structure | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">typical system</span> |
| <small>37 | <small>Installation does not require having a common NFS filesystem or a database back-end, installing special accounts or maintaining configuration files. Gmond has four main responsibilities: Each gmond transmits information in two different ways: Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad). Federation in Ganglia is achieved using a tree of point-to-point connections amongst representative cluster nodes to aggregate the state of multiple clusters. At each node in the tree, a Ganglia Meta Daemon (gmetad) periodically polls a collection of child data sources, parses the collected XML, saves all numeric, volatile metrics to round-robin databases and exports the aggregated XML over a TCP socket to clients. Data sources may be either gmond daemons, representing specific clusters, or other gmetad daemons, representing sets of clusters. Data sources use source IP addresses for access control and can be specified using multiple IP addresses for failover. The latter capability is natural for aggregating data from clusters since each gmond daemon contains the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">entire state</span> of its cluster. Ganglia PHP Web Front-end. The Ganglia web front-end provides a view of the gathered information via real-time dynamic web pages. Most importantly, it displays Ganglia data in a meaningful way for system administrators and computer users.

His arrival marked a change from two traditional communion services to congregations with a variety of styles.<br/><br/>A common condition in people over forty years old is presbyopia, which is caused by the eye's crystalline lens losing elasticity, progressively reducing the ability of the lens to accommodate (i.e. to focus on objects close to the eye). Few people have a pair of eyes that show exactly equal refractive characteristics; one eye may need a "stronger" (i.e. more refracting) lens than the other. Corrective lenses bring the image back into focus on the retina. They are made to conform to the prescription of an ophthalmologist or optometrist. A lensmeter can be used to verify the specifications of an existing pair of glasses. Corrective eyeglasses can significantly improve the life quality of the wearer. Not only do they enhance the wearer's visual experience, but can also reduce problems that result from eye strain, such as headaches or squinting. The most common type of corrective lens is "<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">single vision</span>", which has a uniform refractive index. For people with presbyopia and hyperopia, bifocal and trifocal glasses provide two or three different refractive indices, respectively, and progressive lenses have a continuous gradient. | <small>shared future | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">single vision</span> |

The move was a success. The number of subscribers began to increase and the library increased its role as a cultural centre, both facilitating research and fostering close links with the wider community. It quickly became apparent that lack of space was holding back the library's revival. After spending ten years exploring various options, a decision was made to purchase a 999-year lease on the upper floors of some neighbouring property in 1996. This was followed by an extensive fundraising campaign to pay for the development of this new property. Construction began in 1999 and was completed in time for the opening on 16 September 2000.

They also argue that wildlife management goals of the hunt can be met more effectively by other methods such as "lamping" (dazzling a fox with a bright light, then shooting by a competent shooter using an appropriate weapon and load). There is scientific evidence that fox hunting has no effect on fox populations, at least in Britain, thereby calling into question the idea it is a successful method of culling. In 2001 there was a 1-year nationwide ban on fox-hunting because of an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. It was found this ban on hunting had no <span style="background-color: #00FF00">measurable impact</span> on fox numbers in randomly selected areas. Prior to the fox hunting ban in the UK, hounds contributed to the deaths of 6.3% of the 400,000 foxes killed annually. The hunts claim to provide and maintain a good habitat for foxes and other game, and, in the US, have fostered conservation legislation and put land into conservation easements. Anti-hunting campaigners cite the widespread existence of artificial earths and the historic practice by hunts of introducing foxes, as indicating that hunts do not believe foxes to be pests. It is also argued that hunting with dogs has the advantage of weeding out old, sick, and weak animals because the strongest and healthiest foxes are those most likely to escape. Therefore, unlike other methods of controlling the fox population, it is argued that hunting with dogs resembles natural selection. The counter-argument is given that hunting cannot kill old foxes because foxes have a natural death rate of 65% per annum.<br/><br/>Programs.

After victory against Zimbabwe Pakistan cemented their shot at playing the ICC CWC 2011 Quarters. One of the highlights of the tournament for Pakistan was when they beat Australia, who were led by 3 brilliant pace bowlers, Brett Lee, Shaun Tait and Mitchell Johnson. However Pakistan defied the odds and defeated Australia, courtesy of a brilliant bowling display.<br/><br/>The famous John Murphy, a Catholic priest, emerged as an important Rebel leader at this early stage of the Rebellion. The Rebels were victorious at the Battle of Oulart Hill on 27 May 1798 and took Enniscorthy the next day, establishing one of their main camps at Vinegar Hill, adjacent to the town where thousands flocked to join the rebellion. On 30 May 1798 the rebels defeated a British force on its way to reinforce the garrison at Wexford town at the Battle of Three Rocks. The Government and Loyalist forces at Wexford town panicked and almost the entire garrison fled by a circuitous route, avoiding the rebels, towards Duncannon Fort. The Rebels entered the town in triumph – now almost all of the county was theirs. An attempt to spread the rebellion into Carlow led to defeat on 1 June 1798 at the Bunclody (or Newtownbarry) but on 4 June 1798 a British counterattack was repulsed at "Battle of Tubberneering" and Gorey was taken the same day. On 5 June 1798, the Rebels fought for ten hours at the Battle of New Ross, but failed to take the town. There was <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">huge loss</span> of life and blood literally ran in the streets. Later that day about 120 loyalist prisoners, were killed at Scullabogue, near the Rebel Camp on Carrigbyrne Hill. On 9 June 1798, Wexford Rebels, joined by Rebels from County Wicklow, were defeated at the Battle of Arklow, County Wicklow. On 20 June 1798 a number of loyalists were piked to death on Wexford bridge. | <small>massive losing | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">huge loss</span> |

In 958, two years into the reign of Sancho I of León, he benefited from a rebellion of the nobility that would succeed in briefly placing him on the throne. The Leonese nobles, as well as the disaffected Galician and Castilian ones, had grown sick of the obese Sancho. He received <span style="background-color: #00FF00">particular help</span> in this from his brother-in-law, count Fernán González of Castile, whose daughter he married. However, count Fernán was defeated through a Navarrese and Umayyad alliance on Sancho's behalf in 960, and Ordoño was forced out. Upon losing his throne, Ordoño fled first to Asturias, then Burgos, where he abandoned his wife. This lost him the support of Fernán González, who allied himself with García Sánchez I of Pamplona. The Castilian count sent Ordoño to Ghalib al-Nasiri, commander of the 'Middle Frontier' in Medinaceli, from whom he was passed on to the court of the caliph of Córdoba. There he submitted and made a plea for aid. The caliph at first offered him help, but this led his rival Sancho likewise to offer his submission, thereby neutralizing any benefit to the caliph helping Ordoño, who died in Cordoba, still dethroned. During the short period of his reign, he was married, for political reasons, to Urraca, daughter of Fernán González and formerly wife of his cousin Ordoño III of León.<br/><br/>Higher density revegetation can reduce erosion, protect against extreme temperatures, decrease evaporative losses of water, and increase water filtration and reinfiltration. However, higher density revegetation requires the use of more soil nutrients and water, which can potentially dry out and deplete the soil. For riparianrevegetation, plant roots help to increase the shear strength of bank soil, and if tree roots begin to lose their strength, the bank is susceptible to land slips. Fibrous or matted roots in <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">particular help</span> to prevent against soil erosion, and are typically found in reed and sedge species. Soil replacement. Mine reclamation may involve soil amendment, replacement, or creation, particularly for areas that have been strip mined or suffered severe erosion or soil compaction. In some cases, the native soil may be removed before construction and replaced with fill for the duration of the work. After construction is completed, the fill is again removed and replaced with the reserved native soil for revegetation. Mycorrhizal communities. Mycorrhizae, symbiotic fungal-plant communities, are important to the success of revegetation efforts. Most woody plant species need these root-fungi communities to thrive, and nursery or greenhouse transplants may not have sufficient or correct mycorrhizae for good survival. | <small>specific assistance | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">particular help</span> |

He was aggressive, hot tempered, and the epitome of the traditional samurai. He went down with his ship at Midway. Admiral Ozawa, Nagumo's replacement after the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, was more air-minded but still reticent and deliberate. In 1941, he had been instrumental in the revolutionary development of the "Kidō Butai". Unfortunately for him, his overall command encompassed the period of declining naval resources relative to the Americans and the resultant humiliating IJN defeats. =Japanese invasions of China (1931-1945)= Japan's wartime experience with aircraft carriers began shortly after her forces invaded Manchuria in 1931. With this invasion, Japan extended her control over Chinese territory that had begun with the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. After an "incident" near Shanghai in 1932, Japan attacked China. Japan's victory led to the establishment of Manchukuo, which persisted as a puppet state within the Empire of Japan until the end of World War II. In 1937, another "incident" at Wanping led to fighting near Beijing that escalated into the Second Sino-Japanese War.<br/><br/>According to journalist Harriet Gibsone from "The Guardian", the song had the same energy as Erasure's song "A <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">little respect</span>" (1988). EntertainmentWise commented that "I Don't Care" "sums up the underlying message of the whole project quite nicely". According to Lewis Corner from Digital Spy, the song showcases Cheryl's new-found "F-You" attitude in a "spectrum of rasping electronics, jump-around beats and a massive middle-finger chorus". He considered that the lyrics were directed "at a collective of former love rats, keyboard warriors and sensationalised headlines". Songwriter Bonnie McKee has revealed the song, originally titled “Waking Up Diagonal” after the opening lyric, had been originally written for herself to perform, given the lyrics drew from McKee's life experiences. Along the way, Cheryl and songwriters changed some lyrics and changed the title to "I Don't Care. Critical reception. "I Don't Care" received mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Harriet Gibsone, while writing for "The Guardian" newspaper called it a "bombastic pop blast teetering on the edge of ridiculousness. [...] Song of the year". While reviewing "Only Human" for the same publication, Caroline Sullivan also gave a positive review and described it as an "actual radio-ready chorus to I Don't Care [which has] a jaunty bit of Casio-pop". | <small>minimal regard | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">little respect</span> |

It collects the various partial derivatives of a single function with respect to many variables, and/or of a multivariate function with respect to a single variable, into vectors and matrices that can be treated as single entities. This greatly simplifies operations such as finding the maximum or minimum of a multivariate function and solving systems of differential equations. The notation used here is commonly used in statistics and engineering, while the tensor index notation is preferred in physics. Two competing notational conventions split the field of matrix calculus into two separate groups. The two groups can be distinguished by whether they write the derivative of a scalar with respect to a vector as a column vector or a row vector. Both of these conventions are possible even when the common assumption is made that vectors should be treated as column vectors when combined with matrices (rather than row vectors). A single convention can be somewhat standard throughout a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">single field</span> that commonly uses matrix calculus (e.g. econometrics, statistics, estimation theory and machine learning). | <small>sole area | <small><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">single field</span> |

The station can also be seen from the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">next block</span> at the intersection of an unnamed street leading to Railroad Avenue. The Babylon Branch finally runs along the north side of Oak Street between Garfield and Strong Avenues, where it crosses the Copiague–Lindenhurst village line. In Lindenhurst, the name of CR 12 is changed to Hoffman Avenue. However, this name is also shared by a street running parallel to it on the north side of the Babylon Branch maintained by the village. East of the intersection with CR 3, the road passes in front of Lindenhurst Station, while the village of Lindenhurst's Hoffman Avenue runs behind it. In West Babylon, CR 12's name is changed to South Railroad Avenue, a name it will hold onto upon crossing the border with the village of Babylon. At the border, which is at the intersection of CR 96, is the eastern terminus of CR 12. The roadway east of the terminus reaches NY 109, where it becomes Trolley Line Road, named for the former Babylon Railroad Company, which used the street as part of the route for its streetcar.

In the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">next block</span> is the love song "Ai Coração", "Debaixo do Mesmo Céu", "Assunto Delicado" and "Mulher Não Chora". "Mulher Não Chora" features Solange Almeida of the band Aviões do Forró. Joelma wears a long green dress with pebbles and dances the tango during the song "Você Também Errou", featured on the "Volume 4" album by Banda Calypso, never before performed live. This then turns into the Spanish track "Te Quiero". Joelma sings alongside her three children Natalia Sarraff, Yago and Yasmin the gospel song "O Amor de Deus". The fourth block showcases the Banda Calypso, and includes the long medley "Dançando Calypso / Pra Me Conquistar / Imagino / Dudu / Temporal". As in the concerts of the Avante Tour, Joelma spins with one of her dancers at the end of "Dudu". Soon after the medley, the singer and her two dancers sit on three stools placed on stage and with rehearsed movements, remove their boots and untie their ruffled skirts, revealing a long round skirt typical of carimbó.

Though the east–west leg of the route is longer than the north–south portion, the entire route is signed as north–south. The route starts at an interchange with SR 7 in Bellaire. The route heads west to Belmont where it turns north at an intersection with SR 147. After spending most of the time in Belmont County, SR 149's northern terminus is at SR 9 near New Athens, Harrison County. Route description.

| <small>47 | <small>Of the warships captured in the harbour, the French frigates "Égyptienne" (50) and "Régénérée" (40), and the ex-Venetian frigate "Léoben" (26) went to Britain, while the French frigate "Justice" (44), the ex-Venetian ship of the line "Causse" (64) and frigate "Mantoue" (26), and the ex-Turkish corvettes "Halil Bey", "Momgo Balerie" and "Salâbetnümâ" went to the Turks, under Capitan Pacha (sic). Historians relate that the French garrison, feeling abandoned by an uncaring Republic, gradually abandoned the high standards of conduct and service characteristic of the French Revolutionary Army. Many soldiers refused to renew their oath to the Republic, or did so half-heartedly. In his memoirs, the surgeon-in-chief of Napoleon's Grand Army, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, remembers how the consumption of the meat of young Arab horses helped the French to curb an epidemic of scurvy. He would so start the 19th-century tradition of horse meat consumption in France. The Rosetta Stone. After the surrender, a dispute arose over the fate of French archaeological and scientific discoveries in Egypt. One of the <span style="background-color: #00FF00">key artifacts</span> was the Rosetta Stone which had been discovered in mid-July 1799 by French scientists of the Institut d'Égypte. Menou refused to hand them over, claiming they belonged to the institute. How exactly the stone came into British hands is disputed. Colonel Tomkyns Hilgrove Turner, who escorted the stone to Britain, claimed later that he had personally seized it from Menou and carried it away on a gun carriage.<br/><br/>He says the most dangerous of these misconceptions are: While these misconceptions may fit the risk patterns of a few projects, they are not true for most projects. In a National Research Council report this model was extended to include risks related to human users. To better distinguish them from "hazardous spiral look-alikes", Boehm lists six characteristics common to all authentic applications of the spiral model. The six invariants of spiral model. Authentic applications of the spiral model are driven by cycles that always display six characteristics. Boehm illustrates each with an example of a "dangerous spiral look-alike" that violates the invariant. Define artifacts concurrently. Sequentially defining the <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">key artifacts</span> for a project often increases the possibility of developing a system that meets stakeholder "win conditions" (objectives and constraints). This invariant excludes “hazardous spiral look-alike” processes that use a sequence of incremental waterfall passes in settings where the underlying assumptions of the waterfall model do not apply. Boehm lists these assumptions as follows: In situations where these assumptions do apply, it is a project risk not to specify the requirements and proceed sequentially. The waterfall model thus becomes a risk-driven special case of the spiral model. | <small>major relics | <small><span style="background-color: #00FF00">key artifacts</span> |
| <small>48 | <small>The eight modes can be further divided into four categories based on their final ("finalis"). Medieval theorists called these pairs "maneriae" and labeled them according to the Greek ordinal numbers. Those modes that have d, e, f, and g as their final are put into the groups "protus", "deuterus", "tritus", and "tetrardus" respectively. These can then be divided further based on whether the mode is "authentic" or "plagal." These distinctions deal with the range of the mode in relation to the final. The authentic modes have a range that is about an octave (one tone above or below is allowed) and start on the final, whereas the plagal modes, while still covering about an octave, start a perfect fourth below the authentic. Another interesting aspect of the modal system is the universal allowance for altering B to B no matter what the mode. The inclusion of this tone has several uses, but one that seems particularly common is in order to avoid melodic difficulties caused, once again, by the tritone. These ecclesiastical modes, although they have Greek names, have <span style="background-color: #00FF00">little relationship</span> to the modes as set out by Greek theorists. Rather, most of the terminology seems to be a misappropriation on the part of the medieval theorists Although the church modes have no relation to the ancient Greek modes, the overabundance of Greek terminology does point to an interesting possible origin in the liturgical melodies of the Byzantine tradition. This system is called "octoechos" and is also divided into eight categories, called "echoi".<br/><br/>The girl was apparently kept from Franco by her "bitch" of a mother. In April 2012, viewers are falsely led to believe that Franco is the fraternal twin brother of Jason Morgan (Steve Burton), making him, and Lauren by extension, members of the Quartermaine family. It is later revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton) who had an affair with her mother that destroyed his marriage. Kiki's mother is the mysterious Ava Jerome (Maura West) -- an art dealer from New York City. However, Kiki later learns that Ava is a member of the infamous 80s crime family, the Jerome family—the illegitimate daughter of deceased mobster Victor Jerome and Delia Ryan (Ilene Kristen), a character from the cancelled ABC Daytime soap opera, "Ryan's Hope". Having become accustomed to her mother's lies, Kiki isn't too shocked to learn of her connection to the Jeromes—however, this is another lie that "rocks her world" Alderson stated. This is unfamiliar territory for Kiki because Ava has always shielded her from the crime world. After her mother's presumed death, Kiki starts building a relationship with Silas.

| <small>50 | <small>One was Argentine poet and historian Arturo Capdevila, who wrote about Relgis as a "meritorious" visionary with a "grave and vital message", assuring him: "You can say from now on that you did not suffer in vain, gravely and deeply, the sorrows of the spirit. Your voice will be heard; all of your lesson will be applied." Those Uruguayan public figures who paid homage to Relgis on his 60th anniversary included Socialist Party leader Emilio Frugoni, Colorado Party politician Amílcar Vasconcellos, Zionist academic Joel Gak and poet Carlos Sabat Ercasty. While comparing Relgis' pacifist message with the legendary warnings of Antigone, Frugoni's praise was somewhat skeptical, noting that the Romanian's projects, however grand, could find themselves in disagreement with "the constricting reality". Reviewing such appraisals, Uruguayan philosopher Agustín Courtoisie calls Relgis "eccentric and genial", and sees in him a real-life version of characters in Jorge Luis Borges' fantasy literature. Eugenics. Like other intellectuals of his generation, Eugen Relgis believed that biology served to explain the background of "social and cultural problems that influence the intellectual movement." Controversially, he merged his anarchist perspective with support for eugenics, advocating universal birth control and compulsory sterilization in cases of "degeneration". According to Agustín Courtoisie: "Anarchist pacifism and the once fashionable eugenics seem to be the concepts one can associate with [Relgis]". In favoring this option, Relgis identified himself with those of his anarchist forerunners who were also dedicated neo-Malthusians, and especially with Manuel Devaldès. He praised Devaldès' call for vasectomy as a <span style="background-color: #00FF00">regulatory practice</span>, calling the procedure "a true revolution" in population growth.<br/><br/>Private telecommunication operators initially acquired concession agreements with state enterprises. For mobile phone services, all the concessions have been amended by successive government to last 25 years have gradually ended in 2015. For other services, the concession terms and conditions vary, ranging from one to fifteen years. Nearly all of the concessions are build-operate-transfer (BTO) contracts. The private investor has to build all the required facilities and transfer them to the state before they can operate or offer services to public. Liberalisation took place in the 1990s and 2000s. State enterprises, the Telephone Organization of Thailand, Communications Authority of Thailand, and Mass Communication Organization of Thailand, were corporatised in 2003 and 2004. The Constitution of 1997 prompted the institutional changes when it declared that all the spectrum is a "national communication resource for public welfare". The 1997 Constitution further requires the establishment of "an independent regulator" who shall be authorized to allocate spectra and monitor and regulate communications in Thailand. In 1998, to comply with the constitutional mandate, the parliament passed a law establishing two independent regulators, the National Telecommunication Commission (NTC) and the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC).
